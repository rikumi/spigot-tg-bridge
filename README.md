# Spigot <-> Telegram bridge plugin

### This plugin will send chat messages from Minecraft to Telegram, and from Telegram to Minecraft.

## How to use:

1. Download .jar file from [releases page](https://github.com/kraftwerk28/spigot-tg-bridge/releases), and put it in `plugins/` directory on your server **OR** clone this repo and run `gradle` inside repo's directory.

2. If you already have telegram bot, skip this step. Otherwise create it through [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). You'll go through step-by-step instructions, give a bot __username__ and most importantly, obtain a bot __token__. Save this token for future use. **Note:** in order to make your bot hear raw text messages (not commands), you must disable [privacy mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode) option which is on by default. Go through bot's settings: **Bot Settings -> Group Privacy** and click **Turn Off**.

3. Next, you need to tell plugin about your new bot. You can either:
    - Run Spigot server, plugin will log `"No config file found! Saving default one."`. After that, stop server and proceed to 4th step.
    - Copy [config.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kraftwerk28/spigot-tg-bridge/master/src/main/resources/config.yml) to `plugins/SpigotTGBridge/` in your server directory.

4. A `config.yml` is just a [valid YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file, alternative for JSON, but more human-readable.
   Now, take bot's __token__ which you got in 2nd step and paste them into `config.yml`, so it looks like this:
   ```yaml
   botToken: abcdefghijklmnopq123123123
   # other configuration values...
   ```

5. Run spigot server.

6. Add you bot to chats, where you plan to use it. In each of them, run `/chat_id` command. The bot should respond and give special value - __chat id__. Now, open `config.yml` and paste this ID under `chats` section, so it will look like this:
    ```yaml
    botToken: abcdefghijklmnopq123123123
    chats:
      # Note about doubling minus sign. This is not a mistake, first one means list element, the second one - actual minus
      - -123456789
      - 987654321
      # other chat id's...
    ```

7. You can extend `config.yml` with more tweaks, which are described in the table below, but it's not nesessary, plugin will use default values instead, if they're missing. Also, check out the [example](src/main/resources/config.yml).

8. Re-run server or type `tgbridge_reload` into server's console.
